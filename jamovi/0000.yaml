  Descriptives Functions for Clinicopathological Research Descriptive functions
  from ClinicoPath jamovi module. ClinicoPath help researchers to generate
  natural language summaries of their dataset, generate cross tables with
  statistical tests, and survival analysis with survival tables, survival plots,
  and natural language summaries.

      This function generates a "Table One", a descriptive summary table
      frequently used in  clinicopathological research manuscripts. It supports
      multiple output styles for flexible formatting.

    description: >
      This module generates descriptive statistics for continuous variables.

      It provides both a textual summary and a visually appealing summary table.

      Optionally, you can enable distribution diagnostics to examine normality,
      skewness, and kurtosis.

    description: >
      Comprehensive non-parametric statistical methods including Kruskal-Wallis
      test,

      Friedman test, Mann-Whitney U test, and robust alternatives to classical
      procedures.

      Designed specifically for clinical research where normality assumptions
      are violated.

      This enhanced module combines distribution-free methods with proper effect
      size calculations,

      assumption checking, and post hoc analysis - addressing critical gaps
      identified in 30% 

      of pathology studies that use these methods.
