  Descriptives Functions for Clinicopathological Research Descriptive functions
  from ClinicoPath jamovi module. ClinicoPath help researchers to generate
  natural language summaries of their dataset, generate cross tables with
  statistical tests, and survival analysis with survival tables, survival plots,
  and natural language summaries.

    menuTitle: Table One
    description: >
      This function generates a "Table One", a descriptive summary table
      frequently used in  clinicopathological research manuscripts. It supports
      multiple output styles for flexible formatting.

    description: >
      This module generates descriptive statistics for continuous variables.

      It provides both a textual summary and a visually appealing summary table.

      Optionally, you can enable distribution diagnostics to examine normality,
      skewness, and kurtosis.
