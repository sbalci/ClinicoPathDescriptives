# ClinicoPathDescriptives 0.0.31.84 (2025-10-03)

## New Features

### New Analysis Modules

* **Data Quality Assessment** (`dataquality`): Comprehensive data quality profiling with missing value analysis, distribution assessments, and validation checks
* **Data Checking** (`checkdata`): Interactive data validation and quality control tools
* **Outlier Detection** (`outlierdetection`): Multiple methods for detecting outliers including DBSCAN, robust statistics, and visualization tools
* **Chi-square Post-hoc Tests** (`chisqposttest`): Detailed post-hoc analysis for chi-square tests with pairwise comparisons

### Enhanced Existing Modules

* **Venn Diagrams** (`venn`): Major enhancement with full `ggVennDiagram` integration for 2-7 set comparisons with improved aesthetics and statistical output
* **Age Pyramid** (`agepyramid`): Enhanced visualization options and improved demographic analysis capabilities
* **Variable Tree** (`vartree`): Improved variable handling and hierarchical data structure visualizations
* **Cross-tabulation** (`crosstable`): Added q-value support for multiple comparison corrections with detailed explanations
* **Table One** (`tableone`): Enhanced baseline characteristics tables with improved statistical test selection
* **Alluvial Diagrams** (`alluvial`): Improved flow visualizations for categorical variable relationships
* **Benford's Law Analysis** (`benford`): Enhanced data quality assessment tools with additional diagnostic plots

## Module Migration to OncoPath

* **Swimmer Plot** (`swimmerplot`): Moved to the new **OncoPath** module for oncology-specific visualizations
* **Waterfall Plot** (`waterfall`): Moved to the new **OncoPath** module for oncology-specific visualizations

These oncology-focused visualization tools have been migrated to a dedicated module to better serve cancer research workflows. Users needing swimmer plots and waterfall plots should install the **OncoPath** package.
