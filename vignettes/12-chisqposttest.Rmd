# Introduction

The Chi-Square Post-Hoc Tests module in ClinicoPath provides comprehensive analysis for identifying specific group differences when an overall chi-square test of independence shows statistical significance. This is particularly valuable in clinicopathological research where researchers need to understand which specific combinations of categorical variables are driving significant associations.

## Clinical Motivation

In clinical and pathological research, we often encounter scenarios where:

- **Treatment response varies by patient characteristics** (e.g., sex, age group, tumor stage)
- **Biomarker expression differs across diagnostic categories** (e.g., hormone receptor status by tumor grade)
- **Complications occur differentially across treatment modalities** (e.g., surgical complications by surgeon experience level)
- **Survival outcomes vary by multiple pathological features** (e.g., lymph node status by tumor size categories)

When an overall chi-square test indicates a significant association, post-hoc testing helps identify which specific group comparisons are driving this significance, while controlling for multiple comparisons.

## When to Use Chi-Square Post-Hoc Tests

Chi-square post-hoc tests are appropriate when:

1. **Overall chi-square test is significant** (p < 0.05)
2. **At least one variable has ≥3 categories** (otherwise, no post-hoc testing needed)
3. **Sample sizes are adequate** (expected frequencies ≥5 in most cells)
4. **Variables are categorical** (nominal or ordinal)
5. **Observations are independent**

## Package Setup

```{r setup}
library(ClinicoPathDescriptives)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Load the histopathology dataset
data("histopathology")

# Display dataset structure
str(histopathology[, c("Sex", "Race", "Group", "Grade_Level", "LVI", "PNI", "Mortality5yr")])
```

# Basic Chi-Square Post-Hoc Analysis

## Example 1: Treatment Group by Sex

Let's start with a basic example examining whether treatment group assignment varies by patient sex.

```{r basic-example}
# Basic chi-square post-hoc test
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Sex",
  cols = "Group",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "bonferroni",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
```

### Interpretation

The results show:
1. **Overall Chi-Square Test**: Tests whether there's any association between sex and treatment group
2. **Contingency Table**: Displays observed frequencies for each combination
3. **Post-Hoc Tests**: If significant, shows pairwise comparisons with adjusted p-values

## Example 2: Tumor Grade by Lymph Node Status

A more clinically relevant example examining the relationship between tumor grade and lymph node metastasis:

```{r grade-example}
# Chi-square post-hoc test with clinical variables
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Grade_Level",
  cols = "LVI",  # Lymphovascular invasion
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = TRUE,    # Show expected values
  plot = FALSE
)
```

### Clinical Significance

This analysis helps determine:
- Whether tumor grade is associated with lymphovascular invasion
- Which specific grade categories show significant differences
- Expected vs. observed frequencies for each combination

# Multiple Comparison Adjustments

## Understanding Adjustment Methods

When performing multiple pairwise comparisons, we need to adjust p-values to control the family-wise error rate:

### Bonferroni Correction
- **Most conservative** approach
- Multiplies each p-value by the number of comparisons
- **Use when**: You want strong control of Type I error

```{r bonferroni}
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Race",
  cols = "Mortality5yr",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "bonferroni",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
```

### False Discovery Rate (FDR)
- **Less conservative** than Bonferroni
- Controls the expected proportion of false discoveries
- **Use when**: You want to balance Type I and Type II errors

```{r fdr}
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Race",
  cols = "Mortality5yr",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
```

### Holm Method
- **Step-down procedure**
- More powerful than Bonferroni while maintaining family-wise error control
- **Use when**: You want more power than Bonferroni but still strong control

```{r holm}
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Race",
  cols = "Mortality5yr",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "holm",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
```

## Comparison of Adjustment Methods

```{r adjustment-comparison}
# Create a comparison table of different methods
adjustment_methods <- c("bonferroni", "holm", "fdr", "none")

# Note: In practice, you would run these analyses and compare results
# This is a conceptual example of how different methods affect conclusions

cat("Adjustment Method Comparison:\n")
cat("- Bonferroni: Most conservative, lowest power\n")
cat("- Holm: Good balance of Type I error control and power\n") 
cat("- FDR: Higher power, controls false discovery rate\n")
cat("- None: Highest power, no multiple comparison adjustment\n")
```

# Advanced Features

## Including Expected Values

Expected values help assess the magnitude of deviations from independence:

```{r expected-values}
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "PNI",  # Perineural invasion
  cols = "Grade_Level",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = TRUE,     # Show expected values
  plot = FALSE
)
```

### Interpreting Expected Values

- **Large deviations** indicate strong associations
- **Values in parentheses** are expected frequencies under independence
- **Observed >> Expected**: Positive association
- **Observed << Expected**: Negative association

## Standardized Residuals Plot

The residuals plot feature is available in the jamovi interface and visualizes patterns of association:

```{r residuals-plot-demo, eval=FALSE}
# Plot functionality available in jamovi interface
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Grade_Level",
  cols = "LVI",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE  # Plot available in jamovi interface     # Generate residuals plot
)
```

### Plot Interpretation

When using the plot option in jamovi:
- **Blue cells**: Negative residuals (observed < expected)
- **Red cells**: Positive residuals (observed > expected)
- **Intensity**: Magnitude of standardized residuals
- **|residual| > 2**: Suggests significant contribution to chi-square

# Clinical Examples and Case Studies

## Case Study 1: Biomarker Expression by Tumor Stage

Investigating whether a biomarker's expression varies across tumor stages:

```{r biomarker-case}
# Create a more realistic clinical scenario
# Using Grade and TStage as proxies for biomarker expression levels

# First, let's create meaningful categories
histopathology_clinical <- histopathology %>%
  mutate(
    TStage_Category = case_when(
      TStage <= 1 ~ "Early (T1)",
      TStage == 2 ~ "Intermediate (T2)", 
      TStage >= 3 ~ "Advanced (T3-T4)"
    ),
    Grade_Category = case_when(
      Grade == 1 ~ "Well Differentiated",
      Grade == 2 ~ "Moderately Differentiated",
      Grade == 3 ~ "Poorly Differentiated"
    )
  )

# Analyze the relationship
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology_clinical,
  rows = "TStage_Category",
  cols = "Grade_Category",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = TRUE,
  plot = FALSE  # Plot available in jamovi interface
)
```

### Clinical Interpretation

This analysis reveals:
- Whether tumor stage and grade are associated (overall chi-square)
- Which specific stage-grade combinations are over/under-represented
- Clinical implications for prognosis and treatment planning

## Case Study 2: Treatment Response by Patient Characteristics

Examining treatment efficacy across patient subgroups:

```{r treatment-response}
# Analyze treatment response by patient demographics
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "Group",        # Treatment vs Control
  cols = "Mortality5yr", # 5-year mortality outcome
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "bonferroni",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = TRUE,
  plot = FALSE  # Plot available in jamovi interface
)
```

### Clinical Implications

Results help determine:
- Overall treatment effectiveness
- Whether treatment benefits are consistent across patient groups
- Need for personalized treatment strategies

## Case Study 3: Pathological Features Association

Investigating relationships between multiple pathological features:

```{r pathological-features}
# Multiple pathological features analysis
chisqposttest(
  data = histopathology,
  rows = "LVI",          # Lymphovascular invasion
  cols = "PNI",          # Perineural invasion
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "holm",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,
  exp = TRUE,
  plot = FALSE  # Plot available in jamovi interface
)
```

# Handling Missing Data

## Strategies for Missing Data

```{r missing-data}
# Create dataset with missing values for demonstration
demo_data <- histopathology[1:100, ]
demo_data$Sex[sample(1:100, 10)] <- NA
demo_data$Group[sample(1:100, 8)] <- NA

# Analysis excluding missing data
cat("Analysis excluding missing data:\n")
chisqposttest(
  data = demo_data,
  rows = "Sex",
  cols = "Group",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = TRUE,    # Exclude missing values
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)

# Analysis including missing data as category
cat("\nAnalysis including missing data:\n")
chisqposttest(
  data = demo_data,
  rows = "Sex",
  cols = "Group",
  counts = NULL,
  posthoc = "fdr",
  sig = 0.05,
  excl = FALSE,   # Include missing values
  exp = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
```

### Recommendations for Missing Data

1. **Exclude missing data** when missingness is random
2. **Include as category** when missingness might be informative
3. **Consider imputation** for systematic missingness patterns
4. **Report missing data patterns** in your analysis

# Best Practices and Guidelines

## Statistical Considerations

### Sample Size Requirements
- **Expected frequencies**: ≥5 in at least 80% of cells
- **Minimum cell frequency**: ≥1 in all cells
- **Large samples**: More stable results and better power

### Effect Size Interpretation
- **Cramér's V**: Measure of association strength
  - 0.1 = small effect
  - 0.3 = medium effect  
  - 0.5 = large effect

## Clinical Reporting Guidelines

### Essential Elements to Report

1. **Overall chi-square results**: χ², df, p-value
2. **Sample sizes**: For each group and overall
3. **Adjustment method**: Justification for choice
4. **Significant comparisons**: With adjusted p-values
5. **Effect sizes**: Clinical meaningfulness
6. **Missing data handling**: Exclusions and rationale

### Example Results Section

```{r results-reporting}
cat("Sample Results Reporting:\n\n")
cat("The overall chi-square test revealed a significant association between\n")
cat("tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion (χ² = X.XX, df = X, p < 0.05).\n")
cat("Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using FDR adjustment showed that\n") 
cat("poorly differentiated tumors had significantly higher rates of\n")
cat("lymphovascular invasion compared to well differentiated tumors\n")
cat("(adjusted p = 0.XXX). No other pairwise comparisons reached statistical\n")
cat("significance after multiple comparison adjustment.\n")
```

1. **Use post-hoc tests** only when overall chi-square is significant
2. **Choose adjustment methods** based on your research priorities
3. **Report effect sizes** alongside statistical significance
4. **Consider clinical context** when interpreting results
5. **Validate findings** in independent datasets when possible

The ClinicoPath chi-square post-hoc module provides comprehensive functionality for these analyses, supporting rigorous statistical practices in clinical and pathological research.
