# Getting Started with Biomarker Response Analysis

## Load Required Libraries and Data

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ClinicoPathDescriptives)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(pROC)

# Load the comprehensive biomarker analysis datasets
data("histopathology")
data("treatmentResponse")

# Display overview of available datasets
cat("üìä Biomarker Analysis Datasets Loaded:\n")
cat("   - histopathology: Clinical pathology data with biomarkers (", nrow(histopathology), " patients)\n")

```

## Basic Biomarker Response Workflow

The biomarker response analysis workflow in jamovi follows these steps:

1. **Variable Selection**: Choose biomarker and response variables
2. **Response Type Definition**: Specify binary, categorical, or continuous responses
3. **Threshold Analysis**: Determine optimal biomarker cutoffs
4. **Statistical Testing**: Assess biomarker-response associations
5. **Visualization**: Generate publication-ready plots
6. **Clinical Interpretation**: Translate results into actionable insights

# Core Examples and Applications

## Example 1: Predictive Biomarker Analysis (Binary Response)

Analyzing whether a biomarker predicts treatment response (responder vs. non-responder).

```{r predictive-binary, eval=FALSE}
# Analyze biomarker expression for treatment response prediction
biomarker_result_binary <- biomarkerresponse(
  data = histopathology,
  biomarker = "MeasurementA",
  response = "Death",
  responseType = "binary",
  plotType = "boxplot",
  showThreshold = TRUE,
  thresholdMethod = "optimal",
  performTests = TRUE,
  showCorrelation = FALSE
)

# View the results:
print(biomarker_result_binary$threshold)        # Optimal threshold metrics
print(biomarker_result_binary$groupComparison)  # Group statistics
print(biomarker_result_binary$statisticalTests) # Statistical significance
print(biomarker_result_binary$plot)             # Visualization
```

**Key Biomarker Characteristics in Binary Response:**
- **ROC Analysis**: Determines optimal threshold for classification
- **Sensitivity/Specificity**: Balances true positive vs. false positive rates
- **PPV/NPV**: Provides clinical utility measures
- **Statistical Significance**: Confirms biomarker-response association

## Example 2: Dose-Response Relationship (Continuous Response)

Analyzing how biomarker levels correlate with continuous treatment responses.

```{r continuous-response, eval=FALSE}
# Analyze biomarker correlation with continuous response
biomarker_result_continuous <- biomarkerresponse(
  data = treatmentResponse,
  biomarker = "ResponseValue",  # Using as both biomarker and response for demo
  response = "ResponseValue",
  responseType = "continuous",
  plotType = "scatter",
  addTrendLine = TRUE,
  trendMethod = "loess",
  showCorrelation = TRUE,
  performTests = TRUE
)

# View correlation analysis
print(biomarker_result_continuous$correlation)     # Pearson and Spearman correlations
print(biomarker_result_continuous$statisticalTests) # Correlation significance
```

**Key Features in Continuous Response:**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Quantifies strength of biomarker-response relationship
- **Trend Lines**: Visualizes dose-response curves
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provides uncertainty estimates
- **Multiple Methods**: Pearson for linear, Spearman for non-linear relationships

## Example 3: Multi-Category Response Analysis (Categorical Response)

Analyzing biomarker differences across multiple response categories (CR/PR/SD/PD).

```{r categorical-response, eval=FALSE}
# Analyze biomarker expression across response categories
# First create categorical response from existing data
histopathology_modified <- histopathology %>%
  mutate(
    Response_Category = case_when(
      MeasurementA > quantile(MeasurementA, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE) ~ "Complete Response",
      MeasurementA > quantile(MeasurementA, 0.50, na.rm = TRUE) ~ "Partial Response", 
      MeasurementA > quantile(MeasurementA, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE) ~ "Stable Disease",
      TRUE ~ "Progressive Disease"
    )
  )

biomarker_result_categorical <- biomarkerresponse(
  data = histopathology_modified,
  biomarker = "MeasurementB",
  response = "Response_Category",
  responseType = "categorical",
  plotType = "violin",
  performTests = TRUE,
  confidenceLevel = "0.95"
)

# View group comparisons
print(biomarker_result_categorical$groupComparison)  # Statistics by response group
print(biomarker_result_categorical$statisticalTests) # ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests
```

**Key Features in Categorical Response:**
- **Multiple Group Comparison**: ANOVA for parametric, Kruskal-Wallis for non-parametric
- **Group Statistics**: Mean, median, SD, IQR for each category
- **Effect Size**: Quantifies magnitude of differences between groups
- **Post-hoc Analysis**: Identifies which groups differ significantly

## Example 4: Biomarker Threshold Optimization

Finding the optimal biomarker cutoff for clinical decision-making.

```{r threshold-optimization, eval=FALSE}
# Optimize biomarker threshold using ROC analysis
biomarker_threshold_analysis <- biomarkerresponse(
  data = histopathology,
  biomarker = "MeasurementA",
  response = "Outcome",
  responseType = "binary",
  plotType = "boxplot",
  showThreshold = TRUE,
  thresholdMethod = "optimal",  # ROC-based optimization
  performTests = TRUE
)

# Compare different threshold methods
threshold_comparison <- list(
  optimal = biomarkerresponse(data = histopathology, biomarker = "MeasurementA", 
                             response = "Outcome", thresholdMethod = "optimal"),
  median = biomarkerresponse(data = histopathology, biomarker = "MeasurementA", 
                            response = "Outcome", thresholdMethod = "median"),
  q75 = biomarkerresponse(data = histopathology, biomarker = "MeasurementA", 
                         response = "Outcome", thresholdMethod = "q75")
)

# View threshold performance metrics
print(biomarker_threshold_analysis$threshold)
```

**Threshold Selection Strategies:**
- **ROC-Optimal**: Maximizes Youden index (sensitivity + specificity - 1)
- **Clinical Cutoffs**: Based on established clinical guidelines
- **Percentile-Based**: Uses data distribution (median, quartiles)
- **Manual**: Specified based on prior knowledge or regulatory requirements

## Example 5: Treatment Stratification Analysis

Using biomarkers to stratify patients for different treatment approaches.

```{r treatment-stratification, eval=FALSE}
# Analyze biomarker performance with treatment grouping
biomarker_stratification <- biomarkerresponse(
  data = histopathology,
  biomarker = "MeasurementA",
  response = "Death",
  responseType = "binary",
  groupVariable = "Group",  # Treatment arm stratification
  plotType = "boxplot",
  showThreshold = TRUE,
  thresholdMethod = "optimal",
  performTests = TRUE
)

# View stratified analysis
print(biomarker_stratification$groupComparison)
print(biomarker_stratification$threshold)
print(biomarker_stratification$plot)
```

**Treatment Stratification Benefits:**
- **Precision Dosing**: Adjust treatment intensity based on biomarker
- **Patient Selection**: Identify candidates for specific therapies
- **Combination Therapy**: Optimize multi-drug regimens
- **Clinical Trial Design**: Enrich for responsive populations

# Advanced Biomarker Analysis Techniques

## Understanding Statistical Methods

### **ROC Analysis for Biomarker Evaluation**
Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis provides comprehensive biomarker performance assessment:

- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Overall discriminative ability (0.5-1.0)
- **Sensitivity**: True positive rate (how well it identifies responders)
- **Specificity**: True negative rate (how well it identifies non-responders)
- **PPV (Positive Predictive Value)**: Probability that positive test indicates response
- **NPV (Negative Predictive Value)**: Probability that negative test indicates non-response

**AUC Interpretation:**
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent discrimination
- **0.8-0.9**: Good discrimination
- **0.7-0.8**: Fair discrimination
- **0.6-0.7**: Poor discrimination
- **0.5-0.6**: Fail (no better than chance)

### **Statistical Tests for Different Response Types**

**Binary Response:**
- **T-test**: Compares biomarker means between responders/non-responders
- **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum**: Non-parametric alternative for non-normal data
- **Chi-square**: Tests independence of biomarker status and response

**Categorical Response:**
- **ANOVA**: Compares biomarker means across multiple response groups
- **Kruskal-Wallis**: Non-parametric alternative for non-normal data
- **Post-hoc Tests**: Identifies specific group differences

**Continuous Response:**
- **Pearson Correlation**: Linear relationship between biomarker and response
- **Spearman Correlation**: Monotonic relationship (handles non-linear)
- **Linear Regression**: Quantifies biomarker effect on response

## Advanced Interpretation Guidelines

### **Clinical Significance vs. Statistical Significance**

**Statistical Significance (p < 0.05):**
- Indicates unlikely to occur by chance
- Affected by sample size
- May not be clinically meaningful

**Clinical Significance:**
- Meaningful difference in patient outcomes
- Considers effect size and clinical context
- Guides treatment decisions

**Effect Size Measures:**
- **Cohen's d**: Standardized mean difference
- **Correlation coefficient**: Strength of linear relationship
- **Odds Ratio**: Relative odds of response with biomarker positivity
- **Number Needed to Treat**: Patients needed to treat for one additional response

### **Biomarker Validation Framework**

**Analytical Validation:**
- Accuracy: How close to true value
- Precision: Reproducibility of measurements
- Sensitivity: Limit of detection
- Specificity: Freedom from interference

**Clinical Validation:**
- Sensitivity/Specificity: Diagnostic performance
- Positive/Negative Predictive Value: Clinical utility
- Clinical Utility: Impact on patient outcomes
- Health Economics: Cost-effectiveness

**Regulatory Validation:**
- FDA/EMA guidelines compliance
- Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
- Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
- Medical laboratory accreditation
