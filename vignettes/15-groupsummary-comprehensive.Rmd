# Getting Started

## Required Data Structure

Your dataset should contain:

1. **Grouping Variables**: Categorical variables to group by (factors, characters, or dates)
2. **Summary Variables**: Numeric variables to calculate statistics for
3. **Optional Date Variables**: For time-based aggregation and trend analysis

## Example Datasets

Let's explore the structure of our test datasets:

```{r setup 2}
library(ClinicoPathDescriptives)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load example datasets
data("groupsummary_simple")
data("groupsummary_sales_data")
data("medical_research_data")

# Examine simple dataset structure
str(groupsummary_simple)
```

```{r data-preview}
# Preview different datasets
head(groupsummary_simple) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Simple Grouping Dataset")
```

---

# Basic Grouping and Summarization

## Simple Single-Variable Grouping

Let's start with basic grouping by a single categorical variable:

```{r basic-grouping}
# Basic grouping by category
result_basic <- groupsummary(
  data = groupsummary_simple,
  groupVars = "category",
  sumVars = c("value1", "value2"),
  statistics = c("sum", "mean", "n")
)

# The result object contains the analysis
class(result_basic)
```

## Multiple Statistics Calculation

Calculate different summary statistics for the same data:

```{r multiple-stats}
# All available statistics
result_all_stats <- groupsummary(
  data = groupsummary_simple,
  groupVars = "category",
  sumVars = "value1",
  statistics = c("sum", "mean", "median", "n"),
  addPercentage = TRUE,
  sortBy = "first_desc"
)
```

## Multi-Variable Grouping

Group by multiple categorical variables simultaneously:

```{r multi-group}
# Group by category and group
result_multi <- groupsummary(
  data = groupsummary_simple,
  groupVars = c("category", "group"),
  sumVars = c("value1", "value2"),
  statistics = c("sum", "mean", "n"),
  sortBy = "first_desc"
)
```

# Statistical Considerations

## Understanding Summary Statistics

### Sum
- **Use Case**: Total values, cumulative metrics
- **Example**: Total sales revenue, total production units
- **Interpretation**: Represents the aggregate amount across all observations in each group

### Mean
- **Use Case**: Average performance, typical values
- **Example**: Average customer satisfaction, mean response time
- **Interpretation**: Central tendency that can be influenced by outliers

### Median
- **Use Case**: Robust central tendency, skewed distributions
- **Example**: Median income, median processing time
- **Interpretation**: Middle value that is less affected by extreme values

### Count (n)
- **Use Case**: Sample sizes, frequency analysis
- **Example**: Number of customers, number of transactions
- **Interpretation**: Shows the number of observations in each group

## Sample Size Considerations

Understanding the impact of group sizes on analysis:

```{r sample-sizes}
# Analyze sample sizes across groups
sample_size_analysis <- groupsummary(
  data = medical_research_data,
  groupVars = c("StudyCenter", "TreatmentGroup"),
  sumVars = "ClinicalScore",
  statistics = c("n"),
  sortBy = "first_desc"
)
```

## Dealing with Skewed Data

Strategies for handling skewed distributions:

```{r skewed-data}
# Compare mean vs median for potentially skewed data
skewness_check <- groupsummary(
  data = groupsummary_financial_data,
  groupVars = "market_sector",
  sumVars = c("transaction_amount", "portfolio_value"),
  statistics = c("mean", "median", "n"),
  sortBy = "first_desc"
)
```

# Visualization and Interpretation

## Understanding the Generated Plots

The Group and Summarize module automatically generates appropriate visualizations based on your data:

### Bar Charts
- **When**: Categorical grouping variables
- **Shows**: Comparison of summary statistics across groups
- **Best For**: Regional comparisons, category analysis

### Time Series Plots
- **When**: Date variables with time aggregation
- **Shows**: Trends over time with connecting lines
- **Best For**: Temporal patterns, seasonal analysis

### Reading the Visualizations

Key elements to focus on:

1. **Axis Labels**: Understand what's being measured
2. **Value Labels**: Exact numbers on bars or points
3. **Scale**: Notice the range and magnitude of differences
4. **Trends**: Look for patterns, increases, or decreases

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Comparing Groups
- **Large Differences**: May indicate significant operational or strategic variations
- **Small Differences**: Could suggest consistency or need for more targeted analysis
- **Outliers**: Identify groups that perform unusually well or poorly

### Time-Based Analysis
- **Trends**: Increasing, decreasing, or stable patterns
- **Seasonality**: Regular periodic patterns
- **Anomalies**: Unusual spikes or drops that may need investigation

---

# Best Practices and Recommendations

## Data Preparation

### Before Analysis
1. **Check Data Quality**: Verify data types and handle missing values appropriately
2. **Validate Grouping Variables**: Ensure categorical variables have meaningful levels
3. **Understand Your Data**: Know the business context and expected patterns

### Variable Selection
1. **Meaningful Groups**: Choose grouping variables that align with business questions
2. **Relevant Metrics**: Select summary variables that answer your research questions
3. **Appropriate Statistics**: Choose statistics that make sense for your data type

## Analysis Strategy

### Start Simple
1. **Single Variable Grouping**: Begin with one grouping variable
2. **Essential Statistics**: Start with basic statistics (mean, count)
3. **Build Complexity**: Gradually add more variables and statistics

### Validate Results
1. **Sanity Checks**: Verify results make business sense
2. **Cross-Validation**: Check results against known benchmarks
3. **Sample Sizes**: Ensure adequate sample sizes for reliable statistics

## Reporting and Communication

### Clear Presentation
1. **Descriptive Titles**: Use clear, descriptive analysis titles
2. **Context**: Provide background information for stakeholders
3. **Actionable Insights**: Focus on findings that can drive decisions

### Statistical Literacy
1. **Explain Methods**: Help stakeholders understand the analysis approach
2. **Highlight Limitations**: Discuss data limitations and caveats
3. **Provide Recommendations**: Translate findings into actionable recommendations

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Data Type Issues

### Factor vs Character Variables
```{r data-type-issues}
# Ensure proper data types
groupsummary_sales_data$region <- as.factor(groupsummary_sales_data$region)
groupsummary_sales_data$product_category <- as.factor(groupsummary_sales_data$product_category)
```

### Date Formatting Problems
```{r date-formatting}
# Check date formats before analysis
str(groupsummary_sales_data$sale_date)

# Convert if necessary
# groupsummary_sales_data$sale_date <- as.Date(groupsummary_sales_data$sale_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## Missing Data Strategies

### Understanding Missing Patterns
```{r missing-patterns}
# Check missing data patterns
missing_summary <- medical_research_data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.))))

print(missing_summary)
```

### Handling Missing Values
1. **Exclude Missing**: Use `showMissing = FALSE` for complete case analysis
2. **Include Missing**: Use `showMissing = TRUE` to see missing value patterns
3. **Imputation**: Handle missing values before analysis if appropriate

## Performance Considerations

### Large Datasets
- Consider filtering data to relevant time periods
- Use appropriate date aggregation levels
- Focus on key grouping variables

### Memory Management
- Process large datasets in chunks if necessary
- Use efficient data types (factors for categories)
- Remove unnecessary variables before analysis
